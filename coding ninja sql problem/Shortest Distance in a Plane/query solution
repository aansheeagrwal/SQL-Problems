Problem statement
Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.


Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.


| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |

Query Solution
SELECT ROUND(MIN(SQRT(POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)))::numeric, 2) AS shortest_distance
FROM point_2d p1
JOIN point_2d p2
  ON NOT (p1.x = p2.x AND p1.y = p2.y);
