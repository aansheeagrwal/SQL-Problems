SQL Query Solution :-
SELECT 
    g.genre,
    MAX(e.Domestic + e.Worldwide - i.Budget) AS net_profit
FROM genre g
JOIN earning e ON g.Movie_id = e.Movie_id
JOIN IMDB i ON g.Movie_id = i.Movie_id
WHERE 
    g.genre IS NOT NULL
    AND e.Domestic IS NOT NULL
    AND e.Worldwide IS NOT NULL
    AND i.Budget IS NOT NULL
    AND i.Title LIKE '%(2012)%'
GROUP BY g.genre
ORDER BY g.genre;
