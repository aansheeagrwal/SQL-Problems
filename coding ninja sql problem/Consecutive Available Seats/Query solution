Problem statement
 Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
 Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

 | seat_id | free |
 |------- |------|
 | 1       | 1    |
 | 2       | 0    |
 | 3       | 1    |
 | 4       | 1    |
 | 6       | 1    |

 Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
 Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

Query Solution:-
SELECT seat_id
FROM cinema c
WHERE free IS TRUE
  AND (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM cinema 
      WHERE free IS TRUE 
        AND seat_id = c.seat_id - 1
    )
    OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM cinema 
      WHERE free IS TRUE 
        AND seat_id = c.seat_id + 1
    )
  )
ORDER BY seat_id;
