Problem statement
Table: Department



 Column Name  	 Data Type  
 id	 INT
 revenue	 INT
 month	 VARCHAR


The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].


Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.



The query result format is in the following example: Department table:

 id  	 revenue  	 month  
 1	 8000	 Jan
 2	 9000	 Jan
 3	 10000	 Feb
 1	 7000	 Feb
 1	 6000	 Mar




Result table:


Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).

Query Solution:-
SELECT 
    id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue END) AS May_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id;
